# Auditable Privacy Asset

We want to build an auditable privacy asset standard protocol here.

## Principle
- AI-payment friendly
- Lightweight/aggregable on-chain verification
- Payment-focused design: no general programmability, just modular optional features
- Balanced privacy and auditability
- Cross-chain settlement capability
- Native token fee model: payment tokens can also be used to pay fees (via aggregator service)
- UTXO-based privacy payments: using commitments and nullifiers
- Merkle-tree unspent outputs with nullifier-set logging
- Auditable architecture: supports selective disclosure and asset freezing
